Feature: Look for cross site scripting (xss) using arachni against example.com

Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
     | name   | value                |
     | url    | http://localhost.5000/  |

Scenario: Do a quick check for cross site scripting and verify no issues are found
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=xss --scope-page-limit=1 <url>
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
